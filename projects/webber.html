		Webber is a small development tool that I made for myself when writing simple web pages
		(like this one). I needed something that was small, lightweight, and re-reads files every
		time I reload the page, allowing me to see changes that I made without restarting the
		web server.
		</p>
		<p id=main>
		Another reason why I made it is because I'm not very good at networking, and making this
		helped me learn just a bit more about how everything works, including binding to an ip
		and port, handling client requests, and making a multi-threaded web server (obviously).
		</P>
		<p id=main>
		Also this project was made for myself, to fit my needs. While I might build upon it in the
		future, right now it's not meant for any production use, and I'm only sharing it for
		people who have a similar usecase/people who want to develop it further to fit their needs.
